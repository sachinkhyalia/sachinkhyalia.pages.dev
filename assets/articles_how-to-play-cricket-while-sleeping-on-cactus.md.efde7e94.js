Usually it’s because they’re impatient. They’re dissatisfied with the status quo and they’re not about to wait around for it to get resolved on its own. Action is change, and the motivation for that change stems from an inner disdain for the way things are–and a vivid imagination telling them how things could be better.</p><h2 id="first-sub-section" tabindex="-1">First Sub Section <a class="header-anchor" href="#first-sub-section" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;First Sub Section&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Est commodi iusto et alias deleniti sed voluptatibus tempora est reprehenderit autem ab debitis quisquam non tenetur aliquid.

When you’re doing something–making something, making a decision, making a change, going out on a limb, taking a risk, trying a new approach–you’re inevitably gonna make some noise. You’re going to annoy and perplex people. You’re gonna get questioned, talked about, and doubted.</p>`,18),i=[o];function l(r,p,c,d,u,h){return a(),s("div",null,i)}const m=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
